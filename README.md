# Weather Application

This is a simple weather application made using HTML and some CSS styling. It will allow users to find the current temperature, humidity and wind speed of any city in the world.

## Testing
To test it out, download the files and launch the .html file into a browser. From there, you will be able to enter city names and see the current weather at each location.
